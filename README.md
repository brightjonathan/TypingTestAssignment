<h4>Step by step guide on how to run the application</h4> 

<ul>
 <li> Node must be installed on your computer. You can download Node at nodejs.org. Create React App requires a Node version of at least 10. </li>
 <li> A package manager called npm. It is automatically included in your installation of Node. You need to have an npm version of at least 5.2. </li>
 <li> A good code editor to work with this project files. I highly recommend using the editor Visual Studio Code. You can grab it at code.visualstudio.com. </li>

This is a simple app for users to test and improve their typing skills. The app will present the user with a random text paragraph. Once the test is set up he can start the test and hence the timer. The user needs to type the paragraph in another text box as it is. For each correct word, the user will get 1 point, for each incorrect word the user types he will receive 0 points. Total points will be the total no of words in the paragraph. At the end of the test, the user will be presented with his score which is his typing accuracy and speed.
